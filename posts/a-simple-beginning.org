It all started with a simple classification problem: Given a document,
identify what company it was about.  Here are 10^6 documents we know
how to classify, and here are 10^5 we don't.  A standard undergrad
homework exercise in machine learning, they said.

Little did I know I was headed down the rabbit hole...

A year later, I feel like I'm just beginning to get my head around all
this and I'm going to try to get it down in a form that makes some
sense.
